When you run renv::init(), several important files and directories are created:\n\nrenv.lock, a lock file that records the exact versions of all packages installed and used in your project. This file is crucial for replicating the environment on other machines or by other people.\n.Rprofile, this file is automatically run every time you start R in your project, and renv uses it to configure your R session to use the packages in your project library.\n\nrenv/ directory, a directory that stores the local library of packages specific to your project. It also contains metadata and configuration files that renv uses to manage the environment.\nOther directories and files are also created. To share an R environment, renv.lock, .Rprofile, renv/settings.json and renv/activate.R must be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall packages within renv\n\nInstall packages as usual.

These can be used to break longer scripts into a set of discrete regions according to specific parts of the analysis. In this regard, another good tip is to give the resulting sections sequential numerical IDs:\n\nCode sections are created by inserting a comment line that contains at least four trailing dashes (-), equal signs (=), or pound signs (#):\n\n# Section One ---------------------------------\n \n# Section Two =================================\n \n# Section Three #############################\n\nAlternatively you can use the Code -&gt; Insert Section command. To navigate between code sections you can use the Jump To menu available at the bottom of the editor[2]:\n\n2.
