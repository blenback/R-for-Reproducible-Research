# Let's take a 10 minute break!

# Workflows for Reproducibility

## Workflows for Reproducibility

We will discuss three workflows for reproducibility:

::: incremental
1.  Rstudio project to Zenodo pipeline

2.  Containerization with Docker

3.  Version control with Git
:::

::: fragment
These are suggestions for different approaches and we hope that in future you will be able to adapt these workflows to the needs of your own research projects.

# Quarto

{{< include contents/Quarto_intro.qmd >}}

# Let's take another 10 minute break!

# Now it's your turn!

## Guided exercises

On the website for the masterclass under the heading **Guided exercises** you will find 4 exercises that put into practice the workflows we have discussed as well as the starting to write an academic manuscript with Quarto.

-   The exercises build incrementally on each other but they don't need to be completed in order.

-   Choose which one interests you most or depending on your existing knowledge and expertise.

-   We have allocated 45 minutes to work on the exercises and we will be here to help you if you have any questions.

# Discussion and Feedback

## Discussion and Feedback

This is an open discussion so feel free to raise any points you might have, but here are some ideas: 

- Any questions of understanding or clarification about the content we have covered today?

- What are your own experiences with trying to make your work reproducible? Particular successes or obstacles you have encountered? 

- Are there any other tools or workflows that you have found useful that you would like to share with the group?

- Have you encountered any particular differences in the way that reproducibility is approached in your field/discipline?
