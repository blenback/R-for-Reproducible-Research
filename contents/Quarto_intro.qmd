## A brief introduction to Quarto

Quatro is a unified authoring framework that allows for the integration of code, written material and a wide variety of interactive visual formats into one publishable finished document.

####  Quarto allows you to:

-   Create dynamic content that is updated as your code changes

-   Numerous thematic settings for high quality formatting including 'Pandoc' markdown support for equations and cross-referencing

-   Publish your work as websites or books

-   Edit with any text editor including VS Code, RStudio and more

####  Compatibility Beyond R
Although Quarto we focus on Quartos integration with R, it is also compatible with other programming languages, making it a flexible choice for a variety of users. Quarto supports:

-   **Python**: You can write Python code in Quarto documents to create visualizations, run analyses, and integrate with Python libraries.

-   **Julia**: Quarto allows seamless integration with Julia for those working in the data science or scientific computing community.

-   **Observable**: For JavaScript users, Quarto supports Observable, allowing you to build interactive documents using JavaScript.

This multi-language support makes Quarto a powerful tool that can adapt to your needs, whether you're working in R, Python, Julia, or even a mix of all three.

### Some of the creative ways in which you can use Quarto is:

#### 1. Visualize and publish interactive plots using html widgets

```{r, fig.width=10,fig.height=7}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
p <- ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = cut, fill = clarity)) +
            geom_bar(position = "dodge")
ggplotly(p)
```


#### 2. Create interactive geo-spatial mapping segments

```{r}

library(leaflet)

leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng= 8.548, lat=47.376, popup="ETH")

```

#### 3. Create multi-purpose dashboards to demostrate your research output
