## What is reproducible research?

Reproducibility is a key aspect of reliable scientific research. It
enables other researchers to reproduce the same results using the
original data, code, and documentation [@essawy2020]. Below are the core
principles to ensure reproducibility in research:

**Starts with planning**

Reproducibility begins during the planning stage. It is essential to
organize data management and ensure clear protocols are in place even
before starting the analysis. Consistent Data Storage Regular backups of
data are crucial. Storing data in multiple locations ensures
accessibility and minimizes the risk of data loss. [@alston2021]

**Contains clear documentation**

Thorough documentation is essential to guarantee that data and methods
can be accurately interpreted and reproduced by others. This entails the
use of well-organised files and the inclusion of metadata that describes
the data, how it was obtained, and how it was processed.
[@alston2021][@siraji2023]

**Utilizes version control**

Using version control systems helps track changes in the project over
time. This approach preserves the history of the project and facilitates
the reversion of files to a previous state in the event of an error.
[@alston2021]

**Is accessible**

Data should be stored in nonproprietary, portable formats to ensure
broad accessibility and long-term usability. This practice ensures that
researchers can access the data without relying on specific software
tools. Making data and code publicly available in accessible
repositories supports scientific transparency and allows broader use of
research outputs. [@alston2021][@siraji2023]

By following these steps, researchers contribute to the wider scientific
community, ensuring that their work can be efficiently and accurately
reproduced by others.

## Why strive for reproducible research?

In recent years, various scientific disciplines have experienced what is
known as a "replication crisis". This crisis arises when researchers are
unable to reproduce the headline results of key studies using the
reported data and methods [@moonesinghe2007][@collaboration2015]
[@bohannon2015]. This lack of reproducibility undermines public trust in
science, as it raises doubts about the validity of research findings.

### Advantages of Reproducibility for Your Research

**Personal Reference**

Conducting reproducible research simplifies the process of remembering
how and why specific analyses were performed. This makes it easier to
explain your work to collaborators, supervisors, and reviewers,
enhancing communication throughout your project. [@alston2021]

**Efficient**

Modifications Reproducible research enables you to quickly adjust
analyses and figures when requested by supervisors, collaborators, or
reviewers. This streamlined process can save substantial time during
revisions. [@alston2021]

**Streamlined Future Projects**

By maintaining well-organized and reproducible systems, you can reuse
code and organizational structures for future projects. This reduces the
time and effort required for similar tasks in subsequent research.
[@alston2021]

**Demonstrates Rigor and Transparency**

Reproducibility demonstrates scientific rigor and transparency. It
allows others to verify your methods and results, improving the peer
review process and reducing the risk of errors or accusations of
misconduct. [@alston2021]

**Increases Impact and Citations**

Making your research reproducible can lead to higher citation rates
[@piwowar2007] [@mckiernan2016]. By sharing your code and data, you
enable others to reuse your work, broadening its impact and increasing
its relevance in the scientific community. [@whitlock2011]
[@culina2018].

### Advantages of Reproducibility for Other Researchers

**Facilitates Learning**

Sharing data and code helps others learn from your work more easily. New
researchers can use your data and code as a reference, speeding up their
learning curve and improving the quality of their analyses.
[@alston2021]

**Enables Reproducibility**

Reproducible research makes it simpler for others to reproduce and build
upon your work, fostering more compatible and robust research across
studies. [@alston2021]

**Error Detection**

By allowing others to access and review your data and code,
reproducibility helps detect and correct errors, ensuring that mistakes
are caught early and reducing the chance of their propagation in future
research. [@alston2021]

## Why {{< iconify fa-brands r-project >}} for reproducible research?

R is increasingly recognized as a powerful tool for ensuring
reproducibility in scientific research. Here are some key advantages of
using R for reproducible research:

**Open Source**

Accessibility R is freely available to everyone, eliminating cost
barriers and promoting inclusive access to research tools. This
open-source model ensures that researchers around the world can use and
contribute to its development, fostering a collaborative research
environment. [@siraji2023]

**Comprehensive Documentation**

R encourages thorough documentation of the entire research process. This
ensures that analyses are well-tracked and can be easily replicated
across different projects, enhancing the overall transparency and
reliability of the research.

**Integrated Version Control**

R seamlessly integrates with version control systems like Git, allowing
researchers to track changes to code, data, and documents. This helps
maintain a detailed record of a project's evolution and ensures that all
steps are easily reproducible. [@siraji2023]

**Consistency Across Platforms**

R provides a stable environment that works consistently across different
operating systems, whether you are using Windows, Mac, or Linux. This
cross-platform consistency greatly enhances the reproducibility of
research across diverse systems.

**Broad Community Support**

The R community is large and active, continuously contributing to the
improvement of the software. This broad support makes R a reliable
choice for long-term research projects, ensuring that new tools and
methods are constantly being developed and shared.

**Flexibility and Adaptability**

R offers a wide range of tools and functions that can be adapted to
various research needs. This flexibility allows researchers to handle
diverse tasks within a reproducible framework, making it a versatile
tool for projects of all kinds.

## The FAIR standard

-   **Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and
    Reusability**Â (FAIR).

-   Developed by diverse stakeholders (academia, industry, funders,
    publishers).

-   Addressed the need for infrastructure supporting data reuse.

-   Emphasis on both human and machine readability.

## Why strive for reproducible research?

<!-- Use Mentimeter to take audience suggestions-->

## Why strive for reproducible research?

-   Replication crisis: Allows our work to be verified more thoroughly
-   Improves science for all: Allows others to more easily build upon
    our work

Don't just take our word for it, research funders are increasingly
focused on reproducible research too: EXAMPLE

## Why {{< iconify fa-brands r-project >}} for reproducible research?

-   Open source
-   Large active user community for support
-   Packages to suit just about every research need: statistics,
    modelling, spatial analysis, visualisation (Many packages developed
    by academics)

BUT just using {{< iconify fa-brands r-project >}} doesn't necessarily
make your research reproducible...

We have put together this workshop to share some advice for best
practice and tips that we have picked up along the way.
