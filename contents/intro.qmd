## What is reproducible research?
-   Ability to replicate results:
    -   Others can reproduce the results given only the original data, code, and documentation (Essawy et al. 2020)
-   Starts with planning:
    -   Reproducibility begins with organized data management and sound planning before any analysis is         conducted.
-   Consistent data storage:
    -   Data should be backed up regularly and stored in multiple locations to prevent loss and ensure         accessibility.
-   Clear documentation:
    -   Metadata and well-organized files are essential for interpreting and reproducing research,             ensuring clarity and usability.
-   Version vontrol:
    -   Using version control systems helps track changes and maintain a record of the project's               evolution, aiding in reproducibility.
-   Standardized formats:
    -   Data should be stored in nonproprietary, portable formats to ensure broad accessibility and            long-term usability.
-   Open access:
    -   Data and code should be publicly available in accessible repositories to support transparency          and wider use in the scientific community.


## Why strive for reproducible research?
Advantages for your research

-   Some fields have suffered a 'replication crisis':
    -   In some cases headline results unable to be reproduced using
        reported data and methods: Lowers trust in science
        <!--Give headline figures -->
-   Personal reference:
    -   Simplifies the process of recalling how and why specific analyses were performed, making it            easier to explain your work to collaborators, supervisors, and reviewers.
-   Efficient modifications:
    -   Simplifies the process of adjusting analyses and figures, saving time when supervisors,                collaborators, or reviewers request changes.
-   Streamlined future projects:
    -   Facilitates the re-use of code and organizational systems for similar tasks in new projects,           making them simpler and faster to execute.
-   Demonstrates rigor and transparency:
    -   Enhances trust in your work by allowing others to verify the accuracy of your methods,                 improving peer review and reducing the risk of errors or accusations of misconduct.
-   Increases impact and citations:
    -   Boosts citation rates by enabling others to reuse your code and data, allowing your research to         have a greater influence and be cited in a wider range of contexts.

Advantages for other researchers

-   Facilitates learning:
    -   Provides others with a head start by sharing data and code for easier learning and faster              analysis.
-   Enables reproducibility:
    -   Makes it easier for others to reproduce and build upon your work, supporting stronger and more         compatible research.
-   Error detection:
    -   Helps others identify and correct mistakes, protecting the scientific community from errors.

## The FAIR standard

The FAIR standard was developed....

## Why strive for reproducible research?

<!-- Use Mentimeter to take audience suggestions-->

## Why strive for reproducible research?

-   Replication crisis: Allows our work to be verified more thoroughly
-   Improves science for all: Allows others to more easily build upon
    our work

Don't just take our word for it, research funders are increasingly
focused on reproducible research too: EXAMPLE

## Why {{< iconify fa-brands r-project >}} for reproducible research?

-   Open source
-   Large active user community for support
-   Packages to suit just about every research need: statistics,
    modelling, spatial analysis, visualisation (Many packages developed
    by academics)

BUT just using {{< iconify fa-brands r-project >}} doesn't necessarily
make your research reproducible...

We have put together this workshop to share some advice for best
practice and tips that we have picked up along the way.
