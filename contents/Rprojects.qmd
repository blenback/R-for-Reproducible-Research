## Project set up
start with a .RProj (for wd etc.)
Use .Rprofile to open scripts/load environment
Set up logical directory structure
Break up your process and use master scripts and source sub-scripts

## Environment management
What are environments and why are they needed? (version conflicts/ dependencies etc.
Intro to renv package for environment management. 
Set up a consistent directory structure: Data/, scripts/, results/ tools/ (not every project will be the same!)

## Writing clean code:
### Use a consistent header (hint: use code snippet)
### General good practice: variable names, use functions for repetive tasks
### code folding
### Syntax lintr vs. styler package
