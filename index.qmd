This image highlights some the key concepts we will discuss in the workshop, which have been divided into seperate sections: 

- First we present some [background](@sec-background) on why reproducible and transparent research is important.
- Then we discuss good practice in performing [research projects with R](@sec-Rprojects), focusing on some features of Rstudio that can help ensure your work is reproducibile from the beginning.
- Section 3 presents three [workflows for reproducibility](@sec-workflows) of differing levels of complexity and discusses how they can be combined and which might be best given the research needs. 
- Section 4 presents how the open-source scientific and technical publishing system [Quarto](@sec-Quarto) can be used for numerous academic activities including preparing manuscripts. 
- In section 5 it's time to get hands-on with some [guided exercises](@sec-exercises) to put into practice some of the concepts we have discussed.
- Finally we share a collection of [resources](@sec-resources) that we find particularly helpful in our own journey towards reproducible research.
