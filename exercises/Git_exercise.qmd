## Version control with Git exercise

In this exercise we will show how version control with Git can be implemented for an example R project. The project is the same that is created in the first workflow [exercise](@sec-Rproj_zenodo_exercise), however to save time or in case you haven't completed this exercise we will start with the finished output from it.
