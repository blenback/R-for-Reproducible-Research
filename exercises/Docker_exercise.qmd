## Containerisation with Docker exercise

In this exercise we will create a Docker container for an example R project. The project is the same that is created in the first workflow [exercise](@sec-Rproj_zenodo_exercise), however to save time or in case you haven't completed this exercise we will start with the finished output from it.

### Step 1: Download the resources

-   Click here to download the resources for the exercise: <a href="https://www.example.com/example.zip" class="download"><i class="fa fa-download"></i> <b>Download resources for exercise</b></a>
-   Unzip the downloaded file and move the folder to a location on your computer where you can easily find it.

### Step 2: Download Docker

-   Download Docker Desktop for your operating system from the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
-   Once downloaded run the installer like you would for other software. You may need to restart your computer after installation.
-   While this is happening it is useful to make a Docker account. This is not necessary but can be useful for managing your containers. You can also sign in with your GitHub account.
